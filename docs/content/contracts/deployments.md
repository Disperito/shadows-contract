# Smart Contract Deployments

Shadows uses a custom deployment script to handle deployments in the following environments:

- `mainnet`
- `ropsten`
- `rinkeby`
- `kovan`
- `local` (used for local environment testing)

The current list of addresses, ABIs and sources are available [here](https://developer.shadows.io/api/docs/deployed-contracts.html).

To quickly redirect to the latest contracts on Etherscan, please use the [contract linker](https://contracts.shadows.io) utility. E.g. https://contracts.shadows.io/FeePool

For more detail on how deployments work, please see the <a href="https://github.com/Shadowsio/shadows/blob/master/publish/" target="_blank">publish section</a> of the Shadows repo.
